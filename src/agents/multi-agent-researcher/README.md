# Multi-Agent AI Researcher
A multi-agent AI researcher using Qwen, LangGraph, and Streamlit to find results from the web that matches the user's query and give a summarized answer based on those results. It uses the supervisor architecture to manage multiple agents, where the main agent delegates tasks to other agents.
